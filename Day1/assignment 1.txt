*** Algorithm for finding area of triangle *** 

step1 :  start
step2 :  input b and h // base and height of the triangle
step3 :  area = 1/2 * b * h
step4 :  print area of the triangle 
step5 :  end 


*** Pseudocode for basic arithmetic operations ***

step1 : input a and b
step2 : sum = a+b
step3 : sub = a-b
step4 : mul = a*b
step5 : div = a/b


*** Algorithm to calculate simple interest using formula ***

step1 : Start
step2 : input p, r and t
step3 : SI = p*(1+(r*t))
step4 : print SI
step5 : end


*** Algorithm to find largest of 3 number ***

step1 : start 
step2 : input a, b and c
step3 : if a is greater than b and a is greater than c
		print a is largest
	else if  b is greater than a and b is greater than c 
		print b is largest
	else 
		print c is largest
step4 : end


*** algorithm to check whether given integer is prime or not ***

step1 : start 
step2 : input a number a
step3 : run for loop from i = 2 to square root of a.
step4 : If a is divisible by i , then set = 0.
step5 : If temp =  1
		print a is prime
	else
		print a is not prime
step6 : end
